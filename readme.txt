== Description ==

Oxford Debate is a plugin that allows to incorporate Oxford-Style debates on your website. An Oxford-Style debate is a communication process in which participants argue for and against a given topic.
According to Wikipedia, physical Oxford-Style debate is a competitive debate format featuring a sharply framed motion that is proposed by one side and opposed by another. A winner is declared in an Oxford-Style debate either by the majority or by which team has swayed more audience members between the two votes.
The online version of the Oxford-style debates adapte the physical model and makes it possible to expand the capabilities of both speakers and audience. The speakers may argue using web connectivity and multimedia, and the audience can also comment fixing its position on the proposals of the speakers or raising their own alternatives.
The plugin can be used independently or together with other services conferences, seminars or webinars.
